# DecOpt
Decentralized Stock Options Trading Platformas powered by Chainlink
## Project Description
Our project aims to create a decentralized platform that maps the real-time values of various stocks onto the blockchain, enabling users to buy and sell stock options seamlessly. This platform will provide users with the opportunity to speculate on the future price movements of these stocks without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Through smart contracts, users can create, trade, and exercise stock options in a transparent and trustless environment.

Chainlink integrates for real-time stock data in our decentralized stock options platform, ensuring accuracy and trust in smart contract execution. Additionally, all collateral will be automatically staked in compound finance.

## How it's Made
### Key Features:

Real-Time Stock Price Mapping: We leverage Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time stock market data, ensuring that the mapped stock values on-chain are accurate and reliable.

User-Friendly Interface: Our user interface offers a seamless experience for users to explore available stock options, place orders, and monitor their positions.

Options Creation: Users can create custom stock options with various strike prices and expiration dates, allowing for flexible trading strategies.

Decentralized Settlement: Smart contracts handle the settlement of options contracts, ensuring trustless and transparent execution.

Risk Management: Users can manage their risk exposure by buying and selling stock options, with the ability to close positions at any time before expiration.

Chainlink Integration: Chainlink plays a crucial role in our project by providing real-time stock price data to our smart contracts. By utilizing Chainlink oracles, we ensure that our decentralized stock options trading platform has access to the most accurate and up-to-date market data. This data is used to calculate option prices, monitor market conditions, and execute smart contract logic, providing users with confidence in the fairness and reliability of the trading platform. Chainlink's decentralized oracle network enhances the security and trustworthiness of our platform, making it a robust and dependable solution for stock options trading on the blockchain.

Compound Integration: All collateral will be staked in compound finance for the duration of the Option, and it will be automatically redeemed once this is exercised.
